# 🔐 Password Policy Enforcer (Python)

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple Python-based **Password Policy Enforcer** that checks whether a password meets common security requirements. It demonstrates basic cybersecurity fundamentals, scripting, and automation skills.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To evaluate password strength by enforcing standard security rules and clearly reporting which requirements pass or fail.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Regular Expressions (Regex)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## 🔍 Password Policy Rules
The script checks for:
- Minimum length of **8 characters**
- At least **one uppercase letter**
- At least **one lowercase letter**
- At least **one number**
- At least **one special character**

---

## ▶️ How It Works
1. The user inputs a password.
2. The script checks the password against predefined security rules.
3. Each rule is marked as **PASSED** or **FAILED**.
4. The script determines whether the password is **STRONG** or **WEAK**.
